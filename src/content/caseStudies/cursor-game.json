  "intro": "An image-to-particles transformation driven entirely by custom GLSL, where a cursor-controlled displacement canvas dynamically pushes particles away with a glowing trail. Built with Three.js, shader-based point rendering, and deployed to GitHub Pages via Vite.",

  "problem": "Create a high-performance cursor-driven particle interaction system where an image is reconstructed from GPU-rendered points and dynamically displaced in real time using a 2D canvas as a live displacement texture, while remaining portable to GitHub Pages.",

  "solution": [
    "Converted a full-resolution image into a dense GPU-driven particle field using a subdivided PlaneGeometry with index disabled for true point rendering.",
    "Used a hidden 2D canvas as a live displacement texture, updated every frame with a fading trail buffer.",
    "Mapped cursor position to UV space via raycasting against an invisible interaction plane, so displacement stays aligned with the image.",
    "Generated radial displacement vectors per particle using randomized angles and intensity attributes controlled in the vertex shader.",
    "Applied smoothstep thresholding on the displacement texture to avoid harsh stepping and keep motion feeling fluid.",
    "Computed gl_PointSize in the vertex shader based on image brightness and depth attenuation for proper perspective.",
    "Stamped a glow sprite into the displacement canvas with velocity-based alpha to create a responsive trail effect.",
    "Configured Vite with a custom base path so the static build works cleanly on GitHub Pages."
  ],
  "results": [
    "Responsive cursor-driven particle repulsion with smooth temporal fading and no visible popping.",
    "Image remains recognizable while dynamically deforming under interaction, selling the illusion of a living photo.",
    "Stable frame rate on mid-range hardware with a high-resolution particle field.",
    "Self-contained demo deployed to GitHub Pages and linked directly from the portfolio."
